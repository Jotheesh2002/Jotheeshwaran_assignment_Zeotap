Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets & Support Agent Chatbot for CDP

Overview

This repository contains two cutting-edge projects that demonstrate my expertise in full-stack web development, AI-driven automation, and enterprise-grade solutions:

Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets – A high-performance, cloud-based spreadsheet web app with real-time collaboration, formula support, and seamless user experience.

Support Agent Chatbot for CDP – An AI-powered chatbot that automates customer interactions, integrates with enterprise systems, and enhances customer support efficiency.

Tech Stack

Both projects utilize state-of-the-art technologies for scalability, security, and efficiency:

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, WebSockets

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Redis (for caching and real-time processing)

Database: MongoDB, Firebase (for real-time synchronization)

Authentication: JWT, OAuth, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

AI/ML: OpenAI API, Rasa, TensorFlow (for advanced chatbot intelligence)

Deployment & DevOps: AWS (Lambda, S3, CloudFront), Vercel, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines
